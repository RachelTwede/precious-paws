          <h2>What We're All About</h2>
          <p>
            Our shelter is home to dozens of dogs, cats, and other animals that
            have been abandoned or lost by their original owners. It is our
            mission to provide each of them with food, shelter, protection, and
            comfort, but we need your help. Whether it is through adoption,
            donations, volunteer work, or pet reunification efforts, one thing
            is for sure—these wonderful critters all rely on your help and
            support.
          </p>

              Across the United States, about 6.3 million companion animals
              enter animal shelters each year.
            </li>
            <li>
              Of these animals, approximately 920,000 are euthanized every year.
            </li>
            <li>
              As of 2023, many Utah shelters are overflowing, with little or no
              space to spare for new arrivals.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you adopt from an animal shelter, you save two lives—the pet
              you adopt, and the one who will take their open space in the
              shelter.

          <h2>Animal Care Resources</h2>
          <p>
            Whether you're adopting or purchasing a new pet, it's important to
            know how to prepare, what to expect, and the best practices for
            taking care of your new pal. We've compiled a handy list of
            resources to help.
