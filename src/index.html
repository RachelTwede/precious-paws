        <h2>What We're All About</h2>
        <p>
          Our shelter is home to dozens of dogs, cats, and other animals
          that have been abandoned or lost by their original owners. It is our 
          mission to provide each of them with food, shelter, protection, and comfort,
          but we need your help. Whether it is through adoption, donations, volunteer work, 
          or pet reunification efforts, one thing is for sureâ€”these wonderful 
          critters all rely on your help and support.

          <li>Across the United States, about 6.3 million companion animals 
            enter animal shelters each year. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Of these animals, approximately 920,000 are euthanized every year.
          </li>
          <li>
            As of 2023, many Utah shelters are overflowing, with little or no space 
            to spare for new arrivals.
