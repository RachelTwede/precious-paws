          <h2>Taking Care of Your New Pet</h2>
          <p>
            Bringing a new animal into your home can be exciting, but it's
            important to know that caring for an animal—even something small,
            like a bird or a rabbit—can be a commitment that lasts for years or
            even decades. Pets require more than just food and water, and
            understanding exactly what a new pet requires can help keep these
            animals in safe homes and away from shelters or the streets. If you
            or someone you know is considering getting a pet, the resources
            we've collected here can help!
          </p>
          <h2>Adopt or Buy?</h2>
          <img

          <p>
            When some people think of adopting from a shelter, they are
            concerned that the animals will have behavior issues such as
            aggression or difficulty training. In reality, many of the animals
            in shelters are well-behaved, wonderful creatures who were left
            behind due to their owners moving, getting divorced, or experiencing
            health or financial concerns. When you take this into consideration,
            the pros of adoption far outweigh the cons.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you adopt from a shelter, you are not only saving one
              animal's life, but you are also saving the life of the animal who
              will take their place.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adopting a pet is often far cheaper than buying from a breeder or
              pet store, which can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
              This is especially true when you consider that the adoption fee
              includes the costs of vaccinations, the spay/neuter procedure,
              microchipping, and deworming.
            </li>
            <li>
              While many shelter animals are mixed breeds, this is ultimately a
              good thing. Mixed breed animals tend to live longer, healthier
              lives than purebreeds, which often suffer from health
              complications and can cost a considerable amount in vet bills.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adoption is the ethical choice for more reasons than one. When
              buying a cat or dog from a pet store, it is almost guaranteed that
              they come from a puppy/kitten mill. These horrible places are
              factory-like facilities that prioritize profit over the animals'
              well-being, with poor conditions, little human companionship, and
              inadequate medical care.
