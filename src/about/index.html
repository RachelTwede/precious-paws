          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Precious Paws Animal Shelter was founded in 1995 by Doctor Noah Williams, a local veterinarian
          who wanted to make a difference. Now, the shelter is home to almost one hundred animals who
          would otherwise be left on the street. Our staff and volunteers are dedicated to providing each
          one of these animals with food, water, shelter, and stimulation, and it is our goal to help 
          as many of them as possible to find loving homes of their own.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our aim is to make our community a safer, happier space for the animals that live here by
          providing humane care and adoption for as many of them as possible. In addition to this,
          we also aim to reduce the number of strays on the streets by providing and advocating for better 
          education for pet owners and especially those who are thinking about purchasing a new pet. 
        </p>
